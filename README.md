## Universal Devices ISY994i Z-Wave Device List

### Device Listing
Devices are entered through the GitHub Issues tracking system.  Each "issue" is for a specific Z-Wave device.  Information for each device should be provided including:

- Name
- Vendor website / Product Listing (link)
- Device Manual (link)
- Model information
- Notes specific to setup or use
- Issue Tags:  Tag the device as "works" if it does otherwise as "bug" if it fails

### Device Submission
Currently submission of devices to the issue list is open to the public.  The plan is to keep it this way for the community
to submit their findings and devices and to help the list of devices grow.  However if this gets abused a new system may have
to be created.
